It's still in development but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll work up to what I've written that day.\r\n\r\nTo run: download the package and run index.html in your browser. Runs smoothly in Chrome, mostly smooth in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE.\r\n\r\n<h3>What works</h3>\r\nStartup, movement, combat, opening doors, AI pathing/targeting, line-of-sight, win/loss messages. There's a lot to go.\r\n\r\n<h3>What I'm working on</h3>\r\nBetter combat, multiple maps, by-player fog of war, more weapons/armor/items, custom customizing\r\n\r\n<h3>Stuff I didn't write</h3>\r\njQuery (http://jquery.com/)<br/>\r\nA* Pathing Algorithm in Javascript (https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar/)<br/>\r\nBresenham's Line Algorithm in Javascript (http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Bitmap/Bresenham's_line_algorithm#JavaScript)\r\n\r\n<h3>Did I play a lot of Hero Quest&trade; growing up?</h3>\r\nYes.","google":"UA-248730-18","note":"Don't delete this file!
