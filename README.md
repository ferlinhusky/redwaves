<h1>Over red waves of sand</h1>

<h3>Lo-fi adventure gaming in javascript</h3>

<p><em>In all four directions my fortune it grows<br></em>
<em>but over red waves of sand the wind never blows<br></em>
<em>white sand at dusk turns orange before black<br></em>
<em>over red waves of sand I will not come back</em></p>

<h3>April 2013</h3>
<p>This is a fighting/adventure game in a semi-ASCII style, written in javascript/jQuery. It's
still in development but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll work
up to what I've written that day.</p>

<h3>To run</h3>
<p>Download the package and run index.html in your browser. Runs smoothly in Chrome, mostly smooth
in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE.</p>

<p>Works well in iOS Safari; no idea about Android phones. Worked well in iOS Chrome up until their
last update when their fullscreen deal screwed the page height calculation (or, according to Google,
it's Apple's fault for not properly recalculating page height when the scrollbar is offset; whatever,
it doesn't look right in Chrome for iPhone).

<h3>What I'm working on</h3>

<p>Improving combat, more items/spells/etc., maybe a storyline, who knows. I come up with an idea
in the morning and try to get it coded by the end of the day, or maybe over a couple of days.</p>

<h3>Stuff I didn't write</h3>

<p>jQuery (<a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a>)<br>

<h3>Did I play a lot of Hero Questâ„¢ growing up?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>
