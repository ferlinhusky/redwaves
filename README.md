<h1>Over red waves of sand</h1>

<h3>Lo-fi adventure gaming in javascript</h3>

<p><em>In all four directions my fortune it grows<br></em>
<em>but over red waves of sand the wind never blows<br></em>
<em>white sand at dusk turns orange before black<br></em>
<em>over red waves of sand I will not come back</em></p>

<h3>April 2013</h3>
<p>This is a fighting/adventure game in a semi-ASCII style, written in javascript/jQuery. It's still in development but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll work up to what I've written that day.</p>

<p>To run: download the package and run index.html in your browser. Runs smoothly in Chrome, mostly smooth in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE.</p>

<h3>What works</h3>

<p>Startup, movement, combat, opening doors, AI pathing/targeting, line-of-sight, spellcasting, win/loss messages. There's a lot to go.</p>

<h3>What I'm working on</h3>

<p>Better combat, multiple maps, by-player fog of war, more weapons/armor/items, custom customizing</p>

<h3>Stuff I didn't write</h3>

<h3>Did I play a lot of Hero Questâ„¢ growing up?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>
