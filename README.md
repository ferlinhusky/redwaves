<h3>Lo-fi adventure gaming in javascript</h3>

<h3>August 2013</h3>
<p>This is a fighting/adventure game in a semi-ASCII style, written in JS/jQuery and PHP. It's
still in beta but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll work
up to what I've written that day.</p>

<p>Additionally, you could pretty easily turn this into a battle simulator, a multiplayer something or other,
or even some kind of storytelling device; it's all data-driven and at its core is simply moving things
around a map. Even more at the core it's applying different styles to HTML table cells based on what
arrow key you press. <b>CUTTING EDGE</b></p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>All the 2D adventure you could ask for! From fighting fantastic monsters, casting a wide range
of spells (<del>four</del> six!), all the way to walking and opening (and closing!) doors, ORWoS has it all! All
that I have cared to program!</p>

<p>It's <b>device agnostic</b>, in that I don't know what device it will or won't work on. It's all
<b>HTML5</b> <i>this</i> and <b>CSS3</b> <i>that</i>, but it degrades as gracefully as a dead ballerina.</p>

<p>You like fog of war? You like line-of-sight and the allure of AI pathing? Oh we got that. We
got that like you wouldn't believe.</p>

<p>What about items? Check. A wolfman? Check. Old school negative armor class? Sure why not. HTML tables? ...DOUBLE CHECK. So come on, play it. It's
fun and I keep working on it like every day so it'll just get better. CONFIDENCE.</p>

<h3>What I'm working on now</h3>

<ol>
<li>Creating more @dventures&trade; past the first two</li>
<li>More items to buy and things to do</li>
</ol>

<h3>To run</h3>
<p>Download the package and copy all the files to a new folder on your local server; home is index.php. Runs smoothly in Chrome, mostly smooth
in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE.</p>

<p>You can play it on your phone but I'm working through some UI issues so you'll probably find it
easier to play on a tablet or desktop.</p>

<h3>Did I play a lot of Hero Questâ„¢ growing up?</h3>
