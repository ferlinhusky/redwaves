<h3>Lo-fi adventure gaming in javascript</h3>

<h3>June 2013</h3>
<p>This is a fighting/adventure game in a semi-ASCII style, written in javascript/jQuery. It's
still in development but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll (mostly) work
up to what I've written that day.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>All the 2D adventure you could ask for! From fighting fantastic monsters, casting a wide range
of spells (four!), all the way to walking and opening (and closing!) doors, ORWoS has it all! All
that I have cared to program!</p>

<p>It's <b>device agnostic</b>, in that I don't know what device it will or won't work on. It's all
<b>HTML5</b> <i>this</i> and <b>CSS3</b> <i>that</i>, but it degrades as gracefully as a dead ballerina.</p>

<p>You like fog of war? You like line-of-sight and the allure of AI pathing? Oh we got that. We
got that like you wouldn't believe.</p>

<p>What about items? Check. A wolfman? Check. HTML tables? ...DOUBLE CHECK. So come on, play it. It's
fun and I keep working on it like every day so it'll just get better. CONFIDENCE.</p>

<h3>What I'm working on now</h3>

<ol>
<li>Fixing some save and combat issues.</li>
<li>Adding an armory/shop you know what I mean: a place where you can buy things for your character. I'm thinking
of calling it <b>Equipment House</b>. EQUIPMENT HOUUUUUSE!</li>
<li>Adding more @dventures&trade; because the first one is boring me and the second one isn't finished.
</ol>

<p>I usually come up with an idea in the morning and
try to get it coded by the end of the day, or maybe over a couple of days. It's like agile development
without all the index cards and standing.</p>

<h3>To run</h3>
<p>Download the package and run index.html in your browser. Runs smoothly in Chrome, mostly smooth
in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE.</p>

<p>Works well in iOS Safari; no idea about Android phones. Worked well in iOS Chrome up until their
last update when their fullscreen deal screwed the page height calculation (or, according to Google,
it's Apple's fault for not properly recalculating page height when the scrollbar is offset; whatever,
it doesn't look right in Chrome for iPhone).

<h3>Did I play a lot of Hero Questâ„¢ growing up?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>
