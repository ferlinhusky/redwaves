<h3>August 2014</h3>
<p>This is a fighting/adventure game in a semi-ASCII style, written in JS/jQuery and PHP. It's
still in beta but no commit should break basic functionality. If you run it, it'll work
up to what I've written that day.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>All the 2D adventure you could ask for! From fighting fantastic monsters, casting a wide range
of spells (<del>four</del> six!), all the way to walking and opening (and closing!) doors, ORWoS has it all! All
that I have cared to program! LIMITED FANTASY!</p>

<p>You like fog of war? You like line-of-sight and the allure of AI pathing? Oh we got that. We
got that like you wouldn't believe. NINETEEN NINETY-SIX!</p>

<p>What about items? Check. A wolfman? Check. Old school negative armor class? Sure why not. THAC0? What? Yes.
HTML tables? ...DOUBLE CHECK. So come on, play it. It's fun and I keep working on it like every day so it'll
just get better. CONFIDENCE.</p>

<p>"Hey I heard about this thing called Responsive De-" RESPONSIVE DESIGN!</p>

<h3>What I'm working on now:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Remembering where I left off back in 2013</li>
</ol>

<h3>To run</h3>
<p>Download the package and copy all the files to a new folder on your local server; home is index.php. Runs smoothly
in Chrome, mostly smooth in Firefox and slow to sad in older versions of IE. Works on the iPhone/iPad and whatever
Android devices are on display at Best Buy.</p>

<h3>Stuff I didn't write:</h3>
