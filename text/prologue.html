<h1>Strap Silver and the Red Waves of Sand</h1>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Strap Silver, Hollywood he-man turned Washington G-man, to what do I owe the pleasure of a visit to my humble lab?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strap walks through the doorway silently, shuts the door and locks it behind him, never taking his eyes off Dr Warnoff. His eyes explore the small lab. There on the long wooden table sit myriad flasks and jars, filled with all manner of colorful chemicals. Some are bubbling atop Bunsen burners, others gently smoking of their own accord. On the far end of the table is a black leather valise, not unlike those carried by a doctor on housecall.</p>

<p>Another table, more like a desk, is off on its own, covered in stacks of handwritten papers, no doubt a record of Dr Warnoff's cruel experiments. But what's that in the corner? It looks like a man-sized metal locker, except it's covered in lights and there's a long handle protruding upwards from the base. Strap's eyes fix on it; the doctor notices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see you have taken an interest in my Infinity Box!&rdquo; Warnoff says as he begins to slowly walk towards Strap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Infinity Box you say? What's it do? Ah-ah, doctor...&rdquo;, Strap warns the doctor away from approaching. Warnoff throws up his hands and stops walking. He laughs to himself a bit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Mr Silver it gives you Infinite power! The power to travel through time! To anywhere...anywhere that has ever existed!&rdquo; Dr Warnoff throws his arms wide open with this last statement, as if the whole of the universe were within his reach.</p>

<p>Strap is incredulous. &ldquo;Pardon me, doctor, but I  don't see how traveling through time can give any man infinite power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Warnoff crosses his arms and looks down in thought, then brings a hand to his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr Silver it is a simple matter of imagination plus ambition. An equation so simple even you must be able to solve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Watch what you say, Warnoff, or I might just come up with an equation you won't much like: your mouth minus all of its teeth!&rdquo; Warnoff waves off the threat and continues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, when a man can travel through time, he can bend the fortunes of the world to his own advantage. One thousand, even one hundred years ago, with my scientific knowledge I could become a king among men!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That's where you and I are different doctor; I think I might just grab today's paper and try my luck at yesterday's dog track.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such an obvious choice, Mr Silver, to wish for some...some pocket change! What I'm talking about is something greater! Besides, once you go back in time the future is no longer so cut and dry. Say at this dog track you bump into the wrong person and they just happen to own the winning dog. Well now they're distracted and the winning dog is late to the race. All of a sudden today's paper doesn't do you much good. Now expand that to many centuries and you can see how historical knowledge is almost useless!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You eggheads are all the same, Doctor, you think those big brains of yours are going to let you take over the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We already have, Mr Silver, don't you see? While you 'real men' go about finding reasons to kill one another, we 'eggheads' keep finding ways to make it easier and faster for you to do so. It really is a fantastic trick: we work in the safety of our labs creating the weapons of death and you happily march off to war with them! Why, it's almost laughable when you think about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lousy fool! You think you have the upper hand? Well what do you think of these upper hands!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strap shows his balled-up fists, as large as California cantaloupes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meet Jack Happy and the Piledriver!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr Warnoff sneers like a dog. &ldquo;You 'real men', yes, you're always naming your body parts aren't you? Well do it, do your worst with the weapons your God gave you. He too is an 'egghead' isn't he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody calls God an egghead on my watch!&rdquo; Strap throws a powerful haymaker right into Warnoff's flabby left cheek, knocking the doctor's glasses off into a corner. Warnoff stumbles backwards towards the Infinity Box, steadying himself by grabbing onto the Radioactivator switch. The machine begins to hum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I've got him now,&rdquo; thinks Strap, &ldquo;one more swift kiss on the chin and he'll be out for good.&rdquo; Fists still raised, moving in slow rotations like gypsy moons, Strap advances on the dazed German.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bet you never thought you'd be seeing stars this early in the day, Doctor!&rdquo; Strap winds up like a big league pitcher ready to launch a fireball down the middle, focusing all his power into one perfect punch. He lets loose right at Warnoff's jaw!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; says Warnoff, as he deftly dips the punch and glides a long, thin blade deep into Strap's fully exposed rib cage. Strap collapses silently onto the laboratory floor, his heart punctured by a stiletto wielded in the ice cold hand of a master surgeon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose now we see,&rdquo; mutters Warnoff, &ldquo;who the 'real man' is.&rdquo; He wipes the stiletto clean with his handkerchief, throwing the bloody rag onto his workbench as he walks to the intercom by the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guards, please come to the lab immediately. There has been an incident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Warnoff turns and walks calmly towards the Infinity Box. On his way he grabs the leather valise sitting on the edge of the long wooden table. He opens it slightly and glances inside. Pleased with what he sees, he tosses in his stiletto and closes the bag back up. He holds it close to his chest with one hand.</p>

<p>When he reaches the Infinity Box he slowly extends his free hand and then, grasping the door handle, quickly opens the thin metal door. The hum, which had previously been quite low, is now amplified many times. The doctor braces himself against it and lowers his head as he rushes into the machine.</p>

<p>The metal door of the Infinity Box closes of its own accord. At that very moment the lab door bursts open and {p0}, the captain of the guard, stumbles through having barged it down with one of {p0-poss} two broad shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where's Warnoff? What's happened here?&rdquo;, says {p0} as {p0-pro} regains {p0-poss} balance and surveys the scene.  &ldquo;{p1}, {p2}, check over by those tables. {p3}, make sure the hallway stays clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two guards enter to either side of {p0} and begin their search. {p1} turns back almost immediately, &ldquo;{p0-form}, there's a body!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a pool of blood!&rdquo;, exclaims {p2}, who is almost jumping up and down. {p1} ignores {p2}'s outburst and kneels by the body.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He's face down; I need help turning him over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;{p3}! &ldquo;, {p0} calls, &ldquo;help {p1} turn this body over. {p2}, watch the hallway.&rdquo; {p2} walks slowly towards the door with {p2-poss} eyes over {p2-poss} shoulder. {p3} rushes past {p2-probj} to kneel beside {p1}. Together they slowly roll the corpse face up. {p3} recoils in horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can't be! It simply cannot be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Who is it?&rdquo;, asks {p0}, who now is standing above the body, staring at the slackened face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's...&rdquo;, {p3} pauses, almost unable to believe what {p3-pro}'s seeing. {p3-pro} quickly turns {p3-poss} face up to {p0}, pointing an open hand towards the body.  &ldquo;...it's Strap Silver! The Hollywood movie star! Four times voted the most handsome man in the world. What on earth is he doing here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0} puts {p0-poss} hands on {p0-poss} hips and bends down slightly, narrowing {p0-poss} eyes. {p0-pro} purses {p0-poss} lips and cocks {p0-poss} head to the side, then shakes it slightly as {p0-pro} straightens back up and waves {p3} away. {p0-pro} turns {p0-poss} head towards the door. &ldquo;You watch too many movies, {p3}. {p2}, I said watch the hallway!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All of a sudden the Infinity Box begins to shake violently, its myriad lights flashing quickly in indeterminate patterns. A puff of smoke escapes from under the door. The bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling dims and flashes, throwing strange shadows on the wall.</p>

<p>{p1} and {p3} stand and slowly back away from the body. They bump into {p2} who has come back in the room and is staring wide-eyed at the metal contraption.</p>

<p>What sounds like muffled crowd noises are coming from inside, then the distinct heavy hoof falls of a draught horse. The smell of a wood burning stove fills the room, then the smell of cooked meat following it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back! Get back!&rdquo;, {p0} orders the guards. The four of them rush to the hallway and hunker down. After only half a minute the Infinity Box and the lab as well are seemingly back to normal. The lights on the exterior of the box resume their languid patterns and the smoke dissipates, leaving the room silent and smelling like wet clothes dried by a campfire.</p>

<p>{p0} is the first to re-enter; {p0-pro} motions towards the Infinity Box. &ldquo;Open that door! Warnoff must be inside!&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0-pro} loudly addresses the box: &ldquo;It's okay Dr Warnoff! We're getting you out of there!&rdquo; {p1} and {p2} rush to open the metal door of the Infinity Box, but immediately pull their hands back in shock.</p>

<p>{p1} shakes the burn off {p1-poss} hands. &ldquo;It's too hot! This isn't going to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then the box begins to rumble from within. It sounds like someone is trying to punch their way out, hard. Fist-sized bumps appear on the door with each punch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get back! Draw your weapons! Warnoff or not, I don't like the sound of this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p1} and {p2} take two steps back from the box and draw their service pistols. {p3} places {p3-poss} hand on {p3-poss} holster.</p>

<p>The rumbles grow louder, the bumps on the door appearing more and more quickly, the whole Infinity Box begins to glow red from the heat within. {p1} and {p2} shield their faces from the burning glare as they back up again towards the door of the laboratory.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Infinity Box bursts open and from the open door falls a charred, smoking corpse. It lands face first on the ground, right beside Strap's, burnt arms twisted in a sickening knot. Smoke continues to pour from the machine, rolling across the floor like swamp fog.</p>

<p>{p0} looks up and down the walls. &ldquo;Doesn't Warnoff have some kind of emergency exhaust switch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes I think it's over by that long table; hold on.&rdquo; {p2} manages to activate the exhaust switch. With a slight whir the filtration system kicks in, clearing the room of smoke within a few seconds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, that's better. Get a closer look at that body, {p1}.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p2} cuts in front of {p1} and ambles towards the body with {p2-poss} hands in {p2-poss} pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr Warnoff, I presume.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p1} shoulders {p2-probj} out of the way and kneels by the two bodies. &ldquo;I only met the doctor a few times, but he never struck me as someone so careless that he would step inside a machine like this without knowing exactly what was going to happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p3} pipes up from behind {p2}, &ldquo;I don't think that's the doctor at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0} laughs, &ldquo;Really? Then who is it? Don't tell me Strap Silver has a twin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look, there on the right hand. Isn't that a signet ring?&rdquo; {p3} moves in closer, {p3-poss} index finger guiding {p3-poss} to the charred body like a divining rod.</p>

<p>{p1} leans in on the hand. &ldquo;I can't tell, it looks like it started to melt from the intense heat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father was a jeweler and I saw a lot of old signet rings when I was a child. This looks exactly like one of the ones from his books. The intaglio has been obliterated but see there, where it looks like flowers around the band? Those are Dianthus delphinia, what you would call blue carnations. That means whoever owns...owned this ring was very powerful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p3} reaches in to slide the ring off of the finger. The digit collapses in a small ashen heap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean like a king?&rdquo;, {p2} asks, {p2-poss} voice now quick and high. {p3} eyes the ring up close from all angles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He could be a king. Maybe the heir-apparent. It's hard to tell just by...wait a second.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? What  is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, that's impossible. My father told me it was just a legend!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well what?!&rdquo; {p0} booms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see here, on the inside loop of the ring, it's hard to make out, but do you see the letters?&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0} squints and purses {p0-poss} lips. &ldquo;I don't see anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It says O...M...V...R. Olaf de Mordenaar Van Reuzen. Olaf the Giant-killer. R...G...V...Z. Rode Golven Van Zand. Red waves of sand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0} surveys the room, not really looking anywhere in particular. &ldquo;Olaf the Giant-killer? So this is the body of what, a soldier?&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p3} shakes {p3-poss} head, &ldquo;No no, this is the body of a great warrior. A true giant killer. You've never heard the story?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those Hollywood movies are going to your head, {p3}.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought it was true either, but I can't deny I'm holding his ring!&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p1} rises to {p1-poss} feet and steps between them, &ldquo;You're holding a ring, {p3}, and who knows if those letters even mean what you say they do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where is Dr Warnoff? And if these bodies aren't Strap Silver and Olaf the Giant-killer, then who are they? How did they get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>While {p3}, {p1}, and {p0} discuss the present situation, {p2} creeps slowly towards the open door of the Infinity Box, {p2-poss} eyes locked firmly on the trio. {p2-poss} left hand grips the inside rim of the opening. {p0} glances up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;{p2}! What are you doing? Don't go in there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before {p2-pro} can be reached {p2} slips in and shuts the door firmly. {p0} hammers the door with {p0-poss} fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come out of there! You don't know what could happen!&rdquo; {p0-pro} quickly looks over {p0-poss} shoulder. &ldquo;{p3}, Olaf there, when did he live?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A low hum begins to emanate from the machine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It's hard to say, written accounts of his adventures have been around for well over 500 years but the man himself could be from who knows when!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hum grows louder, the box begins to vibrate. The exterior lights flash in complex patterns.</p>

<p>{p3}'s voice becomes louder to be heard over the hum. &ldquo;Whoever killed him is far too dangerous for any one of us to confront alone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>{p0} pulls at the door with all {p0-poss} strength. {p1} and {p3} both approach and begin banging around the edges, hoping to create a gap they can wedge open. The hum becomes a low growl, filling the room. Even the banging is silenced by the ever-rising, overwhelming reverberations coming from the machine.</p>

<p>{p0} manages to open a gap in the door, magnifying the noise tenfold. {p0-pro} mouths something at them, but even with {p0-poss} lips drawing out the enunciation of each syllable they don't understand. {p0-pro} points at the gap in the door and they nod. {p0-pro} holds {p0-poss} free hand open, {p0-poss} fingers fanned out. {p0-pro} begins dropping fingers one by one. Five, four, three, two, one.</p>

<p>As the final finger drops {p0-pro} flings the door wide open and leaps inside the Infinity Box, followed immediately by {p1} and {p3}. The battered metal door slams shut behind them. The laboratory is filled with a sharp, deafening shriek, then nothing. Shattered test tubes litter the floor. The ceiling bulb has burst, leaving the room dark save for a shaft of hallway light and the twinkling of the box's exterior array. A half minute passes...</p>
